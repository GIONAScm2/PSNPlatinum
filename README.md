# PSNPlatinum
A userscript that augments [PSNProfiles](https://psnprofiles.com/) (PSNP) with various QoL features to enhance the UI/UX.

___
## Installation/Usage
0. Install a userscript manager browser extension (such as [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)).
1. Click [here](https://github.com/T-h0re/PSNPlatinum/raw/main/PSNPlatinum.user.js) to install the script.
2. Make sure you're signed into PSNP, otherwise the script won't work.

#### Mobile Compatibility
- **Android:** Most mobile browsers don't feature browser extensions, so your options are limited. I use [Firefox Nightly](https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2020/09/29/expanded-extension-support-in-firefox-for-android-nightly/).
- **Apple:** Safari should work.
